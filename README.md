# Image-Formation-Simulation-Using-the-Pinhole-Camera-Model-in-MATLAB
 This MATLAB project simulates image formation using the pinhole camera model. It projects 3D scene points onto a 2D image plane, demonstrating how a camera captures images. The project includes 3D scene creation, pinhole projection, and visualization of the projected image plane for a clear understanding of the process.
